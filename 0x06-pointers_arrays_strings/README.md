# PROJECT:- More pointers, arrays and strings

## Description
This folder contains All completed tasks covering C Pointers,arrays and strings. I did as part of ALX program. The detailed outline about each file under this  folder is specified below:

## Concepts covered in this repository:
 
* What are pointers and how to use them
* What are arrays and how to use them
* What are the differences between pointers and arrays
* How to use strings and how to manipulate them
* Scope of variables

## Requirements
* Editor: vi, vim, emacs
* OS: Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
* Compiler: gcc
* Language: C
* All code Should Use: [Betty style](https://github.com/holbertonschool/Betty/wiki)
* All your files should end with a new line
* A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project is mandator
* A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project is mandator
* No more than 5 functions per file
* You are not allowed to use the standard library. Any use of functions like printf, puts, etc… is forbidden
* You are not allowed to use the standard library. Any use of functions like printf, puts, etc… is forbidden


## Description of Declaration files:

All function prototypes are contained at [main.h](./main.h).With the following function signatures:
| 			    Function Signature                               |
| 	`char *_strcat(char *dest, char *src);`                      |                        
| 	`char *_strncpy(char *dest, char *src, int n);`              |
| 	`int _strcmp(char *s1, char *s2);`                           |
| 	`void reverse_array(int *a, int n);`                         |
| 	`char *string_toupper(char *);`                              |
| 	`char *cap_string(char *);`                                  |
| 	`char *leet(char *);`                                        |
| 	`char *rot13(char *);`                                       | 
| 	`void print_number(int n);`                                  | 
| 	`char *infinite_add(char *n1, char *n2, char *r, int size_r);`|
| 	`void print_buffer(char *b, int size);`


## Description of implementation files:
[0-strcat.c](./0-strcat.c) is a function that concatenates two strings.

[1-strncat.c](./1-strncat.c) is a function that concatenates two strings that will use at most n bytes from src.

[2-strncpy.c](./2-strncpy.c) is a function that copies a string.

[3-strcmp.c](./3-strcmp.c) is a function that compares two strings.

[4-rev_array.c](./4-rev_array.c) a function that reverses the content of an array of integers.

[5-string_toupper.c](./5-string_toupper.c) is a function that changes all lowercase letters of a string to uppercase.

[6-cap_string.c](./6-cap_string.c) is a function that capitalizes all words of a string.

[7-leet.c](./7-leet.c) is a function that encodes a string into 1337.

[100-rot13.c](./100-rot13.c) is a function that encodes a string using rot13.

[101-print_number.c](./101-print_number.c) is function that prints an integer. 

[102-magic.c](./102-magic.c) is program prints a[2] = 98, followed by a new line.

[103-infinite_add.c](./103-infinite_add.c) is function that adds two numbers.

[104-print_buffer.c](./104-print_buffer.c) is function that prints a buffer.
