## Requirements
* Editor: vi, vim, emacs
* OS: Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
* Compiler: gcc
* Language: C
* All code Should Use: [Betty style](https://github.com/holbertonschool/Betty/wiki)

## Synopsis


## Concepts to be learned in this repository:
* What are pointers and how to use them
* What are arrays and how to use them
* What are the differences between pointers and arrays
* How to use strings and how to manipulate them
* Scope of variables

## Description of what each file does:
0. Implementation for void reset_to_98() that takes a pointer to an int as parameter and updates the value it points to to 98.
1. Implementation for void swap_int(); that swaps the values of two integers.
2. Implementation for int strlen() that returns the length of a string.
3. Implementation for void puts(char) that void puts(char)
4. Implementation for void print_rev(char) that prints a string, in reverse, followed by a new line.
5. Implementation for void rev_string(char) that reverses a string. 
6. Implementation for void puts2(char) that prints every other character of a string, starting with the first character, followed by a new line.
7. Implementation for void puts_half(char) that prints half of a string, followed by a new line.
